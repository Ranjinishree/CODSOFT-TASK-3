The Credit Card Fraud Detection project aims to develop a machine learning model that can identify fraudulent credit card transactions by analyzing transaction patterns. The dataset typically contains transaction details such as amount, timestamp, and anonymized features representing behavioral patterns. The objective is to preprocess and normalize the data, handle class imbalance using techniques like oversampling or undersampling, and split it into training and testing sets. Various classification algorithms, such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting, are trained to distinguish between fraudulent and genuine transactions. The workflow includes data exploration, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation using metrics like precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC to ensure high fraud detection accuracy while minimizing false positives.
